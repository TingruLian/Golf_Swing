# Golf_Swing
Senior Design Team 20

The goal of this project is to create a golf swing improver focusing on concentration, balance, and consistency. A cross-platform mobile APP will be built to track the motions of the golfer in real-time. Motion sensors may be used to detect the golfer’s actions. Multiple factors of the golfer will be focused on, including body motion detection and head rotation. Data of the golfer’s motion will be recorded, stored and analyzed to monitor the golfer's consistency of swings as well as to keep a record of their improvement over time. MATLAB will be used for video processing and React Native for developing the front-end of the APP.
