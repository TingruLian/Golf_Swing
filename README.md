## Vision and Goals of Project
The goal of this project is to create a golf swing improver that focuses on concentration, balance, and consistency. SwingOn is a cross-platform mobile APP that tracks the motions of the golfer in real-time. Motion sensors may be used to detect the golfer’s actions. Multiple factors of the golfer will be monitored, including body motion detection and head rotation. Data of the golfer’s motion will be recorded, stored and analyzed to calculate the golfer's consistency of their swing as well as to keep a record of their improvement over time. MATLAB will be used for video processing and React Native for developing the front-end of the APP.
